I am a passionate lecturer who encourages learning through growth rather than memory. I research to feed my curiousity. My research interests include computer age statistical inference, FML, banking, and association football. I founded and provides oversight for the Queen's Student Managed fund. I run the masters in quantitative finance, and teaches graduate-level statistics for time series and algorithmic trading and investment. I have extensive statistical consulting and professional training experience and have worked with local companies to build large-scale computer age statistical forecasting infrastructure. Finally, I recently built and maintain a high-performance cloud computing resource for teaching and research in the Management School.
