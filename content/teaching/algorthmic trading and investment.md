title: Algorithmic trading and investment
---
# Overview	
This module will introduce the modern practices in finance of using algorithms to extract computer age statistical inference. The purpose of this course is not to introduce students to the vast array of machine learning algorithms. The purpose is to introduce the emerging field of [Financial Machine Learning (FML)](https://jfds.pm-research.com/).  as a complement to traditional financial research techniques. *Context is king* in computer age statistical inference, and financial datasets used to solve modern investment problems offer unique challenges, which render standard ML algorithms ineffective. 

As Efron and Hastie (2016) explain:
>> Broadly speaking, algorithms are what statisticians do while inference says why they do them. An energetic brand of the statistical enterprise has ﬂourished in the new century, data science, emphasizing algorithmic thinking rather than its inferential justiﬁcation.
	
The era of "Big Data" has provided a backdrop for the rapid expansion of immense computer-based processing algorithms, for instance, random forest for prediction. The importance of inferential arguments in support of the ML applications has emerged as an exciting (yet underdeveloped) field.  This is particularly true for financial research questions where the complexity of the **data story**^[Or more formally the data generating process which underpins the sample] result in notoriously noise covariance matrices.  A  small percentage of information these matrices contain is *signal*, which is systemically suppressed by arbitrage forces. This course will introduce best practice techniques in financial data science which can help illicit economically meaningful *signal* and answer contemporary financial research questions.

# Course plan
	
| Topic | Week | Learning outcome| Book chapters | Papers to read |
|:---:|:---:|:----------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:|
| Why to study financial machine learning? | 1 | The current state-of-play in the quant finance industry. The common fallacy around ML in finance. The ML alternatives to classical approach for scientific theory investigation| Book 1 Chapter 1| (Easley et al., 2020; Wasserstein et al., 2019; Chen, 2020)
| High-performance cloud computing in finance|2| Financial problems are becoming increasingly computationally expensive.  Thus there has been a rapid expansion in HPC solutions in the finance industry.  This includes new numerical methods, HPC systems, and cloud-based deployments. This topic will be an overview of the current landscape and an introduction to the Management schools high performance cloud-computing resource|Book 4||
|Denoising and *detoning* | 3| Covariance matrices in financial are ill-conditioned as a result of a small number of independent observation used to estimate a larger number of parameters. Using ML algorithms based on the [Marcenko-Pastur theorem]() to denoise and denote financial covariance samples.|Book 1 Chapter 2|  |
|Distance metrics | 4| Financial correlation has critical limitations as a measure of codependence in financial research problems. The topic explores the use of [Shannon's entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)#:~:text=In%20information%20theory%2C%20the%20entropy,A%20Mathematical%20Theory%20of%20Communication%22.) theory using ML algorithms to capture important non-linear features of financial data.| Book 1 Chapter 3| |
| Optimal clustering |5 | A common goal in financial research problems is to separate output group entities by maximising *intragroup* similarities or minimising *intergroup* similarities. Using the idea of distance students will be introduced ML techniques to optimise the number and composition of clusters in financial problems. |Book 1 Chapter 4| |
| Financial labels | 6| In supervised learning, financial researchers need to carefully ponder how they label their data, as labels determine the task that the algorithm is going to learn. All academic studies in finance use fixed-horizon labelling.  Return computed on fixed-time labels^[For example daily returns] exhibit substantial heteroskedasticity and dismiss all information in the intermediate returns. Students will be introduced to alternative labelling methods that overcome these limitations, including the triple-barrier, trend-scanning, and meta-labelling methods.  |Book 1 Chapter 5| |
| Explainable machine learning |7| Traditional approach to financial research use the classical econometric approach which combines various specification *guesses* about functional form and explanatory variables and hunts for statistical significance misusing p-values^[This problem is so widespread that the American Statistical Association has discouraged their application as a measure of statistical significance (Wasserstein,2019)]. Students will be introduced to several *glass-box* ML supervised learning techniques to extract robust inference of financial phenomenon.  Topics will include, Mean-Decrease Accuracy, Shapley Values and Accumulated Local Effects | Book 1 Chapter 6| Apley et al., (2020), Strumbelj and Kononenko (2014), Molnar (2019)
|Testing set overfitting| 8 & 9| Understand the dangers of backtesting using historical data and some alternatives to control for the pitfalls. Backtesting using combinatorically purged cross-validation (CPCV), synthetic data.  Learn about important backtesting statistics |Book 1 Chapter 8, Book 2 Chapters 12-15| Prado(2019)
| Round up |10| Review of course material and exam tips | | |

Students should use an RMarkdown report to produce an HTML or pdf essay.  Due end of week 5 submitted electronically via TurnitinUK.
	
## Computer-based practical test (70%)
The assessment will be a mixture of computational, theoretical and inferential questions based on all the course material and readings.  The assessment will be an open-book test, run on the Schools high-performance cloud computing server. Students are monitored on the Server and individual users logs are collected and checked to ensure fairness.
	
## Assessment protocols and learning tips
In both cases, it is important to learn how to read and critique academic papers.  This is a learning process which requires practice.  This [link](https://medium.com/ai-saturdays/how-to-read-academic-papers-without-freaking-out-3f7ef43a070f) provide an excellent guide.  **The lecturer revise the right to orally exam students after each assessment if he suspects *foul-play*.**
