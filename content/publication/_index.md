  abstract = "Financial cooperatives play an important role in the financial
              systems of many countries. They act as a safe haven for deposits
              and are major sources of credit for households and small- and
              medium-sized firms. A not-for-profit orientation (in many cases)
              and a focus on maximising benefits to members have ensured the
              enduring popularity and sustainability of financial cooperatives.
              This is particularly evident since the global financial crisis
              when financial cooperatives continued to extend credit to members
              as many profit-orientated commercial banks restricted credit to
              households and firms. The overarching theme of the first part of
              this review is the structural and behavioural characteristics of
              financial cooperatives. In this part we consider, the origin and
              diffusion of financial cooperatives, network arrangements, the
              business model, relationship banking, balancing the interest of
              members, tax treatment and regulatory framework. The second part
              has performance and contribution to the real economy as the
              overarching theme. In this part we consider, efficiency and
              sustainability, mergers, acquisitions and failures, the benefits
              (and challenges) of FinTech and the contribution of financial
              cooperatives to the real economy including during times of
              crisis. The paper concludes with a summary of what we now know
              (and do not know) about financial cooperatives and provides
              suggestions as to where future research may usefully concentrate.",

  author    = "Gallagher, Ronan and Quinn, Barry",
  abstract  = "ABSTRACTResearch question: In 2010, the governing body of
               European football, UEFA, approved ?Financial Fair Play?
               regulations. Designed to encourage financial discipline, promote
               stability and foster competitive balance, they focus on a
               financial breakeven constraint. We analyse the impact of such
               constraints on the joint sporting and financial efficiency of
               English football clubs.Research methods: The simultaneous
               production of both sporting and financial outputs are modelled
               using stochastic, non-parametric efficiency analysis. The sample
               is an unbalanced panel representing 60 clubs spanning the
               2003/2004 to 2016/2017 seasons.Results and findings: The
               Financial Fair Play breakeven regulation reduces average club
               efficiency, raises the relative importance of financial goals
               (capturing revenue share) whilst lowering the relative
               importance of sporting goals (capturing point share). The
               efficiency costs of regulation are not borne equally by
               clubs.Implications: Breakeven regulations reduce the joint
               sporting and financial efficiency of regulated clubs, with the
               efficiency loss positively related to the severity of the
               breakeven constraint. The Financial Fair Play regulations
               further entrench the financial and sporting power of elite clubs
               and potentially undermine league competitive intensity by
               shifting the relative focus of clubs away from sporting
               productivity toward financial productivity.",

              model complexity",
  author   = "McKillop, Donal G and Quinn, Barry",
  abstract = "This study examines the business model complexity of Irish credit
              unions using a latent class approach to measure structural
              performance over the period 2002 to 2013. The latent class
              approach allows the endogenous identification of a multi-class
              framework for business models based on credit union specific
              characteristics. The analysis finds a three class system to be
              appropriate with the multi-class model dependent on three
              financial viability characteristics. This finding is consistent
              with the deliberations of the Irish Commission on Credit Unions
              (2012) which identified complexity and diversity in the business
              models of Irish credit unions and recommended that such
              complexity and diversity could not be accommodated within a one
              size fits all regulatory framework. The analysis also highlights
              that two of the classes are subject to diseconomies of scale.
              This may suggest credit unions would benefit from a reduction in
              scale or perhaps that there is an imbalance in the present change
              process. Finally, relative performance differences are identified
              for each class in terms of technical efficiency. This suggests
              that there is an opportunity for credit unions to improve their
              performance by using within-class best practice or alternatively
              by switching to another class.",

  abstract = "The global financial crisis underscored the importance of
              regulation and supervision to a well-functioning banking system

              this paper, we contribute to the ongoing policy debate by
              assessing whether compliance with international regulatory
              standards and protocols enhances bank operating efficiency. We
              focus specifically on the adoption of international capital
              standards and the Basel Core Principles for Effective Bank
              Supervision (BCP). The relationship between bank efficiency and
              regulatory compliance is investigated using the Simar and Wilson

              international sample of publicly listed banks. Our results
              indicate that overall BCP compliance, or indeed compliance with

              all Irish credit unions between 2002 and 2010, a particularly
              turbulent period in their history. The analysis explicitly
              addresses the current challenges faced by credit unions in that
              the modeling approach used rewards credit unions for reducing
              undesirable outputs (impaired loans and investments) as well as
              for increasing desirable outputs (loans, earning assets and
              members' funds) and decreasing inputs (labour expenditure,
              capital expenditure and fund expenses). The main findings are:
              credit unions are subject to increasing returns to scale;
              technical regression occurred in the years after 2007; there is
              significant scope for an improvement in efficiency through
              expansion of desirable outputs and contraction of undesirable
              outputs and inputs; and that larger credit unions, that are
              better capitalised and pay a higher dividend to members are more
              efficient than their smaller, less capitalised, and lower
              dividend paying counterparts.",

              to scale which supports the ongoing amalgamation process within
              the sector. Second, although restricted in product offerings,
              markets and their membership base, Japanese cooperatives secured
              both technical progress (a positive shift in the frontier) and a
              decrease in technical inefficiency (distance from the frontier).
              Third, the analysis highlighted that regulatory pressure to
